ArcGIS Python Script - Domain to Text Field
This Python script is designed to be used in ArcGIS as a tool for converting a field with a domain to a text field, mapping the domain codes to their corresponding descriptions.

Usage:
Parameters:

Input Feature Class: Select the feature class containing the field with the domain.
Field Name: Specify the name of the field with the domain.
New Field Name: Enter the name for the new text field where the domain descriptions will be stored.
Running the Tool:

Execute the script by running it as a tool in ArcGIS.
Provide the required parameters as described above.
Output:

Upon successful execution, a new text field will be added to the selected feature class.
The values in this new field will correspond to the descriptions of the domain codes from the original field.
Notes:
Ensure that you have an active ArcGIS project open with access to the desired feature class.
The script retrieves the domain information from the specified field and maps the domain codes to their descriptions.
It then creates a new text field in the feature class and populates it with the corresponding descriptions.
If the specified field does not have a domain or if the domain type is not coded values, an error message will be displayed.
Any errors encountered during execution will be displayed in the ArcGIS tool dialog for troubleshooting.
Troubleshooting:
If an error occurs during the execution of the script, refer to the error message displayed in the ArcGIS tool dialog for guidance.
Verify the input parameters and ensure they meet the requirements specified in the usage instructions.
